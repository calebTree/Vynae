# Vynae - A PowerShell tool for extracting process information using CIM.
# Usage
Current usage accepts two parameters -ID and -Name. Processes can be specified through these parameters, or Vynae can be run without parameters to pull information on every process. Future updates will include advanced parent process ID tracing and data output specifications. There will also be a JSON export option.
# History
This project started as an offshoot of a small script written for CCDC wherein I needed to quickly identify key information about a specific process without access to Process Explorer. I've developed it further in my spare time, and plan on adding additional features over time. Ideally, it will be a light-weight CLI tool for quickly accessing process information.
